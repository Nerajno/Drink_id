## How it wrks
 1. It take your age as an input value  and subtract it from current year.
 2. If your age is >= 21, it auto scrolls to the the section that says yes you can drink.
 3. Else it scrolls to the other section that says no, you can't.
 * It includes a button that makes you scroll back to the top automatically.
