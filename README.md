# So You Think You Can Drink ?
This  project is a simple web app that will check to see if you can drink legally.


## How it wrks

 1. It take input value  and subtract it's number value from current year (all year values are converted or considered as #s.)
 2. If its the product is => 21, it auto scrolls to the the section that says yes you can drink.
 3. Else it scrolls to the other section that says no, you can't.
 * It includes a button that makes you scroll back to the top automatically.

 *[Version 2 considerations === make a countdown clock to show when you can drink that gives an exact date]
